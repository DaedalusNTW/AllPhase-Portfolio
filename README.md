# AllPhase-Portfolio
My first web development project to see the light of day. I built a relatively simple site with a clean design.
The intended purpose was to allow the site owner to show their work to potential clients that are already aware of the business from in-person referals. Due to this, we did not have a particular focus on organic traffic. However we still averaged over 1000 visitors a month, growing from an initial 40 - 60 when it first launched.

On a technical level, it is quite simple. 
Small amounts of Javascript and PHP add barebones functionality. 
At this time I had limited knowledge of either so I kept it as simple as possible while focusing on my core skillset of HTML/CSS.

*This project is no longer live. I moved the website to Wordpress, redesigned the whole thing. And uploaded the old code here to github.*
