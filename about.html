        <strong>The Business</strong>
		<p>
         The company was originally founded as an electrical contracting company, in October 1998.
         But back then, all we did was electrical work. As time went on, we added additional things to our skill set, like; HVAC and audio/video work. In 2006, we started doing general construction and building houses. 
         Since then, we have focused on improving our efficiency, quality of work and attention to detail. 
         Over the years, things have changed and we have changed, but our commitment to our clients has only improved.
         We realize that in construction, things never go perfectly or exactly according to plan, but we always strive to minimize the complications and the drama involved in building, so as to give the client the best possible experience.
         That is our commitment to our valued clients and project partners.
